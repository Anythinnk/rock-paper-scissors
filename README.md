This project is an attempt at building a simple rock-paper-scissors game, with the aim of familiarizing myself with JavaScript, DOM manipulation and event listeners.

These are the skills learnt and demonstrated while working towards the above objective:
- CSS grid for the layout of the body of the page, and for easy reorganization of containers/content for different window widths
- Flexbox for organization of elements within the grids (if required)
- DOM methods to add/alter elements on the page (such as increasing the relevant score/number of rounds)
- Event listeners to enable buttons to call specific functions
- Keyframes and simple animation properties to allow the display image to emulate the hand movement when playing the game in real life
- Use of pseudo-elements to create a toggle button from a checkbox for a dark-mode toggle
