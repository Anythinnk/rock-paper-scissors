<!--
Using the indexes of the choices wrt the array allChoices:
    Rock: 0, Paper: 1, Scissors: 2
And taking the difference to be calculated using 
playerIndex - computerIndex = difference:
    (a) If rock vs paper: 0 - 1 = -1 (lose)
    (b) If paper vs rock: 1 - 0 = 1 (win)
    (c) If rock vs scissors: 0 - 2 = -2 (win)
    (d) If scissors vs rock: 2 - 0 = 2 (lose)
    (e) If scissors vs paper: 2 - 1 = 1 (win)
    (f) If paper vs scissors: 1 - 2 = -1 (lose)
    (g) draw cases: difference of 0

If absolute difference = 2, multiply result by -0.5:
    Case (c) difference becomes 1
    Case (d) becomes -1
and we end up with:
    1 = player wins, -1 = player loses, 0 = draw
